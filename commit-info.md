Hardcoded test data into my-store.js, `getClientData` loads
data from variable instead of from a remote server (demo purposes
only).

Changed acSearch parameters to use `arguments` instead of
`...theArgs` (experimental feature, only works with FF). Changed
relevant call in `addRemoveList`.

TO DO:
[ ] Resolve speed issue between phonegap and jqm
[ ] Add reports view?
